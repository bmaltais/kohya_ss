This is a GUI and CLI for training diffusion models.

This project provides a user-friendly Gradio-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion training scripts](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). 
Stable Diffusion training empowers users to customize image generation models by fine-tuning existing models, creating unique artistic styles, 
and training specialized models like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation).

Key features of this GUI include:
*   Easy-to-use interface for setting a wide range of training parameters.
*   Automatic generation of the command-line interface (CLI) commands required to run the training scripts.
*   Support for various training methods, including LoRA, Dreambooth, fine-tuning, and SDXL training.

Support for Linux and macOS is also available. While Linux support is actively maintained through community contributions, macOS compatibility may vary.

## Installation Options

You can run `kohya_ss` either **locally on your machine** or via **cloud-based solutions** like Colab or Runpod.

- If you have a GPU-equipped PC and want full control: install it locally using `uv` or `pip`.
- If your system doesnâ€™t meet requirements or you prefer a browser-based setup: use Colab or a paid GPU provider like Runpod or Novita.
- If you are a developer or DevOps user, Docker is also supported.

### Local Installation Overview

You can install `kohya_ss` locally using either the `uv` or `pip` method. Choose one depending on your platform and preferences:

| Platform     | Recommended Method | Instructions                                |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Linux        | `uv`           | [uv_linux.md](./docs/Installation/uv_linux.md) |
| Linux or Mac | `pip`              | [pip_linux.md](./docs/Installation/pip_linux.md)               |
| Windows      | `uv`           | [uv_windows.md](./docs/Installation/uv_windows.md)             |
| Windows      | `pip`          | [pip_windows.md](./docs/Installation/pip_windows.md)           |

#### `uv` vs `pip` â€“ What's the Difference?

- `uv` is faster and isolates dependencies more cleanly, ideal if you want minimal setup hassle.
- `pip` is more traditional, easier to debug if issues arise, and works better with some IDEs or Python tooling.
- If unsure: try `uv`. If it doesn't work for you, fall back to `pip`.

### Cloud Installation Overview

#### ðŸ¦’ Colab

For browser-based training without local setup, use this Colab notebook:  
<https://github.com/camenduru/kohya_ss-colab>

- No installation required
- Free to use (GPU availability may vary)
- Maintained by **camenduru**, not the original author

| Colab                                                                                                                                                                          | Info               |

> ðŸ’¡ If you encounter issues, please report them on camenduruâ€™s repo.

**Special thanks**  
I would like to express my gratitude to camenduru for their valuable contribution.

#### Runpod, Novita, Docker

These options are for users running training on hosted GPU infrastructure or containers.

- **[Runpod setup](docs/runpod_setup.md)** â€“ Ready-made GPU background training via templates.
- **[Novita setup](docs/novita_setup.md)** â€“ Similar to Runpod, but integrated into the Novita UI.
- **[Docker setup](docs/docker.md)** â€“ For developers/sysadmins using containerized environments.


## Custom Path Defaults

The repository now provides a default configuration file named `config.toml`. This file is a template that you can customize to suit your needs.

To use the default configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `config example.toml` file from the root directory of the repository to `config.toml`.
2. Open the `config.toml` file in a text editor.
3. Modify the paths and settings as per your requirements.

This approach allows you to easily adjust the configuration to suit your specific needs to open the desired default folders for each type of folder/file input supported in the GUI.

You can specify the path to your config.toml (or any other name you like) when running the GUI. For instance: ./gui.bat --config c:\my_config.toml

## LoRA

To train a LoRA, you can currently use the `train_network.py` code. You can create a LoRA network by using the all-in-one GUI.

Once you have created the LoRA network, you can generate images using auto1111 by installing [this extension](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks).

For more detailed information on LoRA training options and advanced configurations, please refer to our LoRA documentation:
- [LoRA Training Guide](docs/LoRA/top_level.md)
- [LoRA Training Options](docs/LoRA/options.md)

## Sample image generation during training

A prompt file might look like this, for example:

```txt
# prompt 1
masterpiece, best quality, (1girl), in white shirts, upper body, looking at viewer, simple background --n low quality, worst quality, bad anatomy, bad composition, poor, low effort --w 768 --h 768 --d 1 --l 7.5 --s 28

# prompt 2
masterpiece, best quality, 1boy, in business suit, standing at street, looking back --n (low quality, worst quality), bad anatomy, bad composition, poor, low effort --w 576 --h 832 --d 2 --l 5.5 --s 40
```

Lines beginning with `#` are comments. You can specify options for the generated image with options like `--n` after the prompt. The following options can be used:

- `--n`: Negative prompt up to the next option.
- `--w`: Specifies the width of the generated image.
- `--h`: Specifies the height of the generated image.
- `--d`: Specifies the seed of the generated image.
- `--l`: Specifies the CFG scale of the generated image.
- `--s`: Specifies the number of steps in the generation.

The prompt weighting such as `( )` and `[ ]` is working.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting steps below.

### Page File Limit

If you encounter an X error related to the page file, you may need to increase the page file size limit in Windows.

### No module called tkinter

If you encounter an error indicating that the module `tkinter` is not found, try reinstalling Python 3.10 on your system.

### LORA Training on TESLA V100 - GPU Utilization Issue

See [Troubleshooting LORA Training on TESLA V100](docs/troubleshooting_tesla_v100.md) for details.

## SDXL training

For detailed guidance on SDXL training, please refer to the [official sd-scripts documentation](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/blob/main/README.md#sdxl-training) and relevant sections in our [LoRA Training Guide](docs/LoRA/top_level.md).

## Masked loss

The masked loss is supported in each training script. To enable the masked loss, specify the `--masked_loss` option.

> [!WARNING]
> The feature is not fully tested, so there may be bugs. If you find any issues, please open an Issue.

ControlNet dataset is used to specify the mask. The mask images should be the RGB images. The pixel value 255 in R channel is treated as the mask (the loss is calculated only for the pixels with the mask), and 0 is treated as the non-mask. The pixel values 0-255 are converted to 0-1 (i.e., the pixel value 128 is treated as the half weight of the loss). See details for the dataset specification in the [LLLite documentation](./docs/train_lllite_README.md#preparing-the-dataset).

## Guides

The following are guides extracted from issues discussions

### Using Accelerate Lora Tab to Select GPU ID

#### Starting Accelerate in GUI

- Open the kohya GUI on your desired port.
- Open the `Accelerate launch` tab
- Ensure the Multi-GPU checkbox is unchecked.
- Set GPU IDs to the desired GPU (like 1).

#### Running Multiple Instances (linux)

- For tracking multiple processes, use separate kohya GUI instances on different ports (e.g., 7860, 7861).
- Start instances using `nohup ./gui.sh --listen 0.0.0.0 --server_port <port> --headless > log.log 2>&1 &`.

#### Monitoring Processes

- Open each GUI in a separate browser tab.
- For terminal access, use SSH and tools like `tmux` or `screen`.
