# Kohya's GUI

This repository provides a Windows-focused Gradio GUI for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion trainers](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). The GUI allows you to set the training parameters and generate and run the required CLI commands to train the model.

If you run on Linux and would like to use the GUI, there is now a port of it as a docker container. You can find the project [here](https://github.com/P2Enjoy/kohya_ss-docker).

## Required Dependencies

- Install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe) 
  - make sure to tick the box to add Python to the 'PATH' environment variable
- Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- Install [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

## Installation

### Ubuntu
In the terminal, run

```
git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
cd kohya_ss
bash ubuntu_setup.sh
```

then configure accelerate with the same answers as in the Windows instructions when prompted.

### Windows

Give unrestricted script access to powershell so venv can work:

- Run PowerShell as an administrator
- Run `Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted` and answer 'A'
- Close PowerShell

Open a regular user Powershell terminal and run the following commands:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
cd kohya_ss

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install torch==1.12.1+cu116 torchvision==0.13.1+cu116 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116
pip install --use-pep517 --upgrade -r requirements.txt
pip install -U -I --no-deps https://github.com/C43H66N12O12S2/stable-diffusion-webui/releases/download/f/xformers-0.0.14.dev0-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl

cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\*.dll .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\cextension.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cextension.py
cp .\bitsandbytes_windows\main.py .\venv\Lib\site-packages\bitsandbytes\cuda_setup\main.py

accelerate config
```

### Optional: CUDNN 8.6

This step is optional but can improve the learning speed for NVIDIA 30X0/40X0 owners. It allows for larger training batch size and faster training speed.

Due to the file size, I can't host the DLLs needed for CUDNN 8.6 on Github. I strongly advise you download them for a speed boost in sample generation (almost 50% on 4090 GPU) you can download them [here](https://b1.thefileditch.ch/mwxKTEtelILoIbMbruuM.zip).

To install, simply unzip the directory and place the `cudnn_windows` folder in the root of the this repo.

Run the following commands to install:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate

python .\tools\cudann_1.8_install.py
```

## Upgrading

When a new release comes out, you can upgrade your repo with the following commands in the root directory:

```powershell
git pull

.\venv\Scripts\activate

pip install --use-pep517 --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

Once the commands have completed successfully you should be ready to use the new version.

## Launching the GUI using gui.bat or gui.ps1

The script can be run with several optional command line arguments:

--listen: the IP address to listen on for connections to Gradio.
--username: a username for authentication.
--password: a password for authentication.
--server_port: the port to run the server listener on.
--inbrowser: opens the Gradio UI in a web browser.
--share: shares the Gradio UI.

These command line arguments can be passed to the UI function as keyword arguments. To launch the Gradio UI, run the script in a terminal with the desired command line arguments, for example:

`gui.ps1 --listen 127.0.0.1 --server_port 7860 --inbrowser --share`

or

`gui.bat --listen 127.0.0.1 --server_port 7860 --inbrowser --share`

## Launching the GUI using kohya_gui.py

To run the GUI, simply use this command:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate

python.exe .\kohya_gui.py
```

## Dreambooth

You can find the dreambooth solution specific here: [Dreambooth README](train_db_README.md)

## Finetune

You can find the finetune solution specific here: [Finetune README](fine_tune_README.md)

## Train Network

You can find the train network solution specific here: [Train network README](train_network_README.md)

## LoRA

Training a LoRA currently uses the `train_network.py` code. You can create a LoRA network by using the all-in-one `gui.cmd` or by running the dedicated LoRA training GUI with:

```
.\venv\Scripts\activate

python lora_gui.py
```

Once you have created the LoRA network, you can generate images via auto1111 by installing [this extension](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks).

## Troubleshooting

### Page File Limit

- X error relating to `page file`: Increase the page file size limit in Windows.

### No module called tkinter

- Re-install [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.9/python-3.10.9-amd64.exe) on your system.
- Alternatively, add 'set "TCL_LIBRARY=C:\Program Files (x86)\Python310\tcl\tcl8.6"' to your run_command_line.bat and run_popup.bat files, replacing the path with the correct path for your system.

### FileNotFoundError

This is usually related to an installation issue. Make sure you do not have any python modules installed locally that could conflict with the ones installed in the venv:

1. Open a new powershell terminal and make sure no venv is active.
2.  Run the following commands:

```
pip freeze > uninstall.txt
pip uninstall -r uninstall.txt
```

This will store your a backup file with your current locally installed pip packages and then uninstall them. Then, redo the installation instructions within the kohya_ss venv.

    - Sample image generation:
        A prompt file might look like this, for example

        ```
        # prompt 1
        masterpiece, best quality, 1girl, in white shirts, upper body, looking at viewer, simple background --n low quality, worst quality, bad anatomy,bad composition, poor, low effort --w 768 --h 768 --d 1 --l 7.5 --s 28

        # prompt 2
        masterpiece, best quality, 1boy, in business suit, standing at street, looking back --n low quality, worst quality, bad anatomy,bad composition, poor, low effort --w 576 --h 832 --d 2 --l 5.5 --s 40
        ```

        Lines beginning with `#` are comments. You can specify options for the generated image with options like `--n` after the prompt. The following can be used.

        * `--n` Negative prompt up to the next option.
        * `--w` Specifies the width of the generated image.
        * `--h` Specifies the height of the generated image.
        * `--d` Specifies the seed of the generated image.
        * `--l` Specifies the CFG scale of the generated image.
        * `--s` Specifies the number of steps in the generation.

        The prompt weighting such as `( )` and `[ ]` are not working.

    Please read [Releases](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/releases) for recent updates.
