# Kohya's GUI

This repository primarily provides a Gradio GUI for [Kohya's Stable Diffusion trainers](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts). However, support for Linux OS is also offered through community contributions. macOS support is not optimal at the moment but might work if the conditions are favorable.

The GUI allows you to set the training parameters and generate and run the required CLI commands to train the model.

## Installation

### Windows

#### Windows Pre-requirements

To install the necessary dependencies on a Windows system, follow these steps:

1. Install [Python 3.10.11](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.10.11/python-3.10.11-amd64.exe).
   - During the installation process, ensure that you select the option to add Python to the 'PATH' environment variable.

2. Install [CUDA 11.8 toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows&target_arch=x86_64).

3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

4. Install the [Visual Studio 2015, 2017, 2019, and 2022 redistributable](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vc_redist.x64.exe).

#### Setup Windows

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired installation directory.

2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
   ```

3. Change into the `kohya_ss` directory:

   ```shell
   cd kohya_ss
   ```

4. Run the setup script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   .\setup.bat
   ```

   During the accelerate config step, use the default values as proposed during the configuration unless you know your hardware demands otherwise. The amount of VRAM on your GPU does not impact the values used.

#### Optional: CUDNN 8.9.6.50

The following steps are optional but will improve the learning speed for owners of NVIDIA 30X0/40X0 GPUs. These steps enable larger training batch sizes and faster training speeds.

1. Run `.\setup.bat` and select `2. (Optional) Install cudnn files (if you want to use the latest supported cudnn version)`.

### Linux and macOS

#### Linux Pre-requirements

To install the necessary dependencies on a Linux system, ensure that you fulfill the following requirements:

- Ensure that `venv` support is pre-installed. You can install it on Ubuntu 22.04 using the command:

  ```shell
  apt install python3.10-venv
  ```

- Install the CUDA 11.8 Toolkit by following the instructions provided in [this link](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64).

- Make sure you have Python version 3.10.9 or higher (but lower than 3.11.0) installed on your system.

#### Setup Linux

To set up the project on Linux or macOS, perform the following steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the desired installation directory.

2. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
   ```

3. Change into the `kohya_ss` directory:

   ```shell
   cd kohya_ss
   ```

4. If you encounter permission issues, make the `setup.sh` script executable by running the following command:

   ```shell
   chmod +x ./setup.sh
   ```

5. Run the setup script by executing the following command:

   ```shell
   ./setup.sh
   ```

   Note: If you need additional options or information about the runpod environment, you can use `setup.sh -h` or `setup.sh --help` to display the help message.

#### Install Location

The default installation location on Linux is the directory where the script is located. If a previous installation is detected in that location, the setup will proceed there. Otherwise, the installation will fall back to `/opt/kohya_ss`. If `/opt` is not writable, the fallback location will be `$HOME/kohya_ss`. Finally, if none of the previous options are viable, the installation will be performed in the current directory.

For macOS and other non-Linux systems, the installation process will attempt to detect the previous installation directory based on where the script is run. If a previous installation is not found, the default location will be `$HOME/kohya_ss`. You can override this behavior by specifying a custom installation directory using the `-d` or `--dir` option when running the setup script.

If you choose to use the interactive mode, the default values for the accelerate configuration screen will be "This machine," "None," and "No" for the remaining questions. These default answers are the same as the Windows installation.

### Runpod

#### Manual installation

To install the necessary components for Runpod and run kohya_ss, follow these steps:

1. Select the Runpod pytorch 2.0.1 template. This is important. Other templates may not work.

2. SSH into the Runpod.

3. Clone the repository by running the following command:

   ```shell
   cd /workspace
   git clone https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
   ```

4. Run the setup script:

   ```shell
   cd kohya_ss
   ./setup-runpod.sh
   ```

5. Run the GUI with:

   ```shell
   ./gui.sh --share --headless
   ```

   or with this if you expose 7860 directly via the runpod configuration:

   ```shell
   ./gui.sh --listen=0.0.0.0 --headless
   ```

6. Connect to the public URL displayed after the installation process is completed.

#### Pre-built Runpod template

To run from a pre-built Runpod template, you can:

1. Open the Runpod template by clicking on <https://runpod.io/gsc?template=ya6013lj5a&ref=w18gds2n>.

2. Deploy the template on the desired host.

3. Once deployed, connect to the Runpod on HTTP 3010 to access the kohya_ss GUI. You can also connect to auto1111 on HTTP 3000.

### Docker

#### Local docker build

If you prefer to use Docker, follow the instructions below:

1. Ensure that you have Git and Docker installed on your Windows or Linux system.

2. Open your OS shell (Command Prompt or Terminal) and run the following commands:

   ```bash
   git clone --recursive https://github.com/bmaltais/kohya_ss.git
   cd kohya_ss
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

   Note: The initial run may take up to 20 minutes to complete.

   Please be aware of the following limitations when using Docker:

   - All training data must be placed in the `dataset` subdirectory, as the Docker container cannot access files from other directories.
   - The file picker feature is not functional. You need to manually set the folder path and config file path.
   - Dialogs may not work as expected, and it is recommended to use unique file names to avoid conflicts.
   - This Dockerfile has been designed to be easily disposable. You can discard the container at any time and docker build it with a new version of the code. To update the system, run update scripts outside of Docker and rebuild using `docker compose down && docker compose up -d --build`.

   If you are running Linux, an alternative Docker container port with fewer limitations is available [here](https://github.com/P2Enjoy/kohya_ss-docker).

#### ashleykleynhans runpod docker builds

You may want to use the following Dockerfile repositories to build the images:

- Standalone Kohya_ss template: <https://github.com/ashleykleynhans/kohya-docker>
- Auto1111 + Kohya_ss GUI template: <https://github.com/ashleykleynhans/stable-diffusion-docker>

## Upgrading

To upgrade your installation to a new version, follow the instructions below.

### Windows Upgrade

If a new release becomes available, you can upgrade your repository by running the following commands from the root directory of the project:

1. Pull the latest changes from the repository:

   ```powershell
   git pull
   ```

2. Run the setup script:

   ```powershell
   .\setup.bat
   ```

### Linux and macOS Upgrade

To upgrade your installation on Linux or macOS, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the root directory of the project.

2. Pull the latest changes from the repository:

   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

3. Refresh and update everything:

   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

## Starting GUI Service

To launch the GUI service, you can use the provided scripts or run the `kohya_gui.py` script directly. Use the command line arguments listed below to configure the underlying service.

```text
--listen: Specify the IP address to listen on for connections to Gradio.
--username: Set a username for authentication.
--password: Set a password for authentication.
--server_port: Define the port to run the server listener on.
--inbrowser: Open the Gradio UI in a web browser.
--share: Share the Gradio UI.
--language: Set custom language
```

### Launching the GUI on Windows

On Windows, you can use either the `gui.ps1` or `gui.bat` script located in the root directory. Choose the script that suits your preference and run it in a terminal, providing the desired command line arguments. Here's an example:

```powershell
gui.ps1 --listen 127.0.0.1 --server_port 7860 --inbrowser --share
```

or

```powershell
gui.bat --listen 127.0.0.1 --server_port 7860 --inbrowser --share
```

### Launching the GUI on Linux and macOS

To launch the GUI on Linux or macOS, run the `gui.sh` script located in the root directory. Provide the desired command line arguments as follows:

```bash
gui.sh --listen 127.0.0.1 --server_port 7860 --inbrowser --share
```

## Custom Path Defaults

The repository now provides a default configuration file named `config.toml`. This file is a template that you can customize to suit your needs.

To use the default configuration file, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `config example.toml` file from the root directory of the repository to `config.toml`.
2. Open the `config.toml` file in a text editor.
3. Modify the paths and settings as per your requirements.

This approach allows you to easily adjust the configuration to suit your specific needs to open the desired default folders for each type of folder/file input supported in the GUI.

## LoRA

To train a LoRA, you can currently use the `train_network.py` code. You can create a LoRA network by using the all-in-one GUI.

Once you have created the LoRA network, you can generate images using auto1111 by installing [this extension](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-webui-additional-networks).

## Sample image generation during training

A prompt file might look like this, for example:

```txt
# prompt 1
masterpiece, best quality, (1girl), in white shirts, upper body, looking at viewer, simple background --n low quality, worst quality, bad anatomy, bad composition, poor, low effort --w 768 --h 768 --d 1 --l 7.5 --s 28

# prompt 2
masterpiece, best quality, 1boy, in business suit, standing at street, looking back --n (low quality, worst quality), bad anatomy, bad composition, poor, low effort --w 576 --h 832 --d 2 --l 5.5 --s 40
```

Lines beginning with `#` are comments. You can specify options for the generated image with options like `--n` after the prompt. The following options can be used:

- `--n`: Negative prompt up to the next option.
- `--w`: Specifies the width of the generated image.
- `--h`: Specifies the height of the generated image.
- `--d`: Specifies the seed of the generated image.
- `--l`: Specifies the CFG scale of the generated image.
- `--s`: Specifies the number of steps in the generation.

The prompt weighting such as `( )` and `[ ]` is working.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, refer to the troubleshooting steps below.

### Page File Limit

If you encounter an X error related to the page file, you may need to increase the page file size limit in Windows.

### No module called tkinter

If you encounter an error indicating that the module `tkinter` is not found, try reinstalling Python 3.10 on your system.

### LORA Training on TESLA V100 - GPU Utilization Issue
#### Issue Summary
When training LORA on a TESLA V100, users reported low GPU utilization. Additionally, there was difficulty in specifying GPUs other than the default for training.

#### Potential Solutions
- **GPU Selection:** Users can specify GPU IDs in the setup configuration to select the desired GPUs for training.
- **Improving GPU Load:** Utilizing `adamW8bit` optimizer and increasing the batch size can help achieve 70-80% GPU utilization without exceeding GPU memory limits.

## SDXL training

The documentation in this section will be moved to a separate document later.

## Masked loss

The masked loss is supported in each training script. To enable the masked loss, specify the `--masked_loss` option.

The feature is not fully tested, so there may be bugs. If you find any issues, please open an Issue.

ControlNet dataset is used to specify the mask. The mask images should be the RGB images. The pixel value 255 in R channel is treated as the mask (the loss is calculated only for the pixels with the mask), and 0 is treated as the non-mask. The pixel values 0-255 are converted to 0-1 (i.e., the pixel value 128 is treated as the half weight of the loss). See details for the dataset specification in the [LLLite documentation](./docs/train_lllite_README.md#preparing-the-dataset).

## Change History

### 2024/03/27 (v23.1.0)

- Update sd-scripts to 0.8.6
  - The dependent libraries are updated. Please see [Upgrade](#upgrade) and update the libraries.
    - Especially `imagesize` is newly added, so if you cannot update immediately, please install with `pip install imagesize==1.4.1`.
    - `bitsandbytes==0.43.0`, `prodigyopt==1.0`, `lion-pytorch==0.0.6` are included in the requirements.txt.

The settings for each subset are correctly applied to each image. PR [#1205](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1205) Thanks to feffy380!
  - `train_network.py` and `sdxl_train_network.py` are modified to record some dataset settings in the metadata of the trained model (`caption_prefix`, `caption_suffix`, `keep_tokens_separator`, `secondary_separator`, `enable_wildcard`).
  - DeepSpeed is supported. PR [#1101](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1101)  and [#1139](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1139) Thanks to BootsofLagrangian! See PR [#1101](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1101) for details.
  - The masked loss is supported in each training script. PR [#1207](https://github.com/kohya-ss/sd-scripts/pull/1207) See [Masked loss](#masked-loss) for details.
  - Some features are added to the dataset subset settings.
    - `secondary_separator` is added to specify the tag separator that is not the target of shuffling or dropping. 
      - Specify `secondary_separator=";;;"`. When you specify `secondary_separator`, the part is not shuffled or dropped. 
    - `enable_wildcard` is added. When set to `true`, the wildcard notation `{aaa|bbb|ccc}` can be used. The multi-line caption is also enabled.
    - `keep_tokens_separator` is updated to be used twice in the caption. When you specify `keep_tokens_separator="|||"`, the part divided by the second `|||` is not shuffled or dropped and remains at the end.
    - The existing features `caption_prefix` and `caption_suffix` can be used together. `caption_prefix` and `caption_suffix` are processed first, and then `enable_wildcard`, `keep_tokens_separator`, shuffling and dropping, and `secondary_separator` are processed in order.
    - See [Dataset config](./docs/config_README-en.md) for details.
  - The dataset with DreamBooth method supports caching image information (size, caption).

- Major code refactoring thanks to @wkpark. This will make updating sd-scripts cleaner by keeping sd-scripts files separate from the GUI files. This will also make configuration more streamlined with fewer tabs and more accordion elements. Hope you like the new style.
- This new release is implementing a significant structure change, moving all of the sd-scripts written by kohya under a folder called sd-scripts in the root of this project. This folder is a submodule that will be populated during setup or GUI execution.
